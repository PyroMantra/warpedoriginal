Upon a new campaign being launched, the enrollment channel will open where you can type /roll d100 for a chance to participate. 8 players with the highest rolls will be selected. If you wish to roll again in the case of a low number, you may do so by donating $10.



Each selected player will receive a stat sheet of their character in their private channel. The Game Masters (GM) are the Gods of the Planes. They are referred to as GM's outside of the Game and as Gods during the Game.



Your Stat sheet will be updated by a Game Master every single time a stat changes, be it from an item, picked up gold, or ability.





In-game Days (also referred to as Turns) last 24 hours of real life time, unless all players finish their turns early.

All players do their turns simultaneously, in their private channel.

Players regenerate 10 Health and 10 Resource by default at the start of every Day.

You die and lose the game when your Health reaches 0, unless overridden.

Death is permanent unless you have an ability saying otherwise.



To see a list of things you can do check the link above. Usually you'll do things like move, strike, prepare, loot, equip. However there are no limits in this game and you can do anything you wish, if it's not a default action you will simply have to make an attempt.

On any creative action you will say I attempt to....and roll a D20.

To roll a D20 you will use the bot command /roll d20.

To end your turn type End Turn





Sometimes, some things will not be the way they seem. That is because a lot of spells can cause confusion or play tricks on you. The GMs will pay extra attention to details, but they won't always be able to explain to you why something happened. (For the sake of the game).

However if you have any questions at all, you can ping or DM the Game Masters directly or @One of the Gods.



Map Phase



The spots your character stands on in Map Phase are called Hexes. There are 3 Types of Hexes(Simple, Forests and Special) These 3 Form a Biome; There are multiple Biomes, each with their unique enemies and loot you can explore. When traversing the map, you will type move followed by the direction you want to move to. You can also explore Hexes by typing explore and /rolling a d10. It takes STAMINA to traverse a Hex or explore one.



Screenshots will be sent to you by the GM upon moving but you can also request it by asking for it. The amount of Hexes your character can see is determined by your Vision which is set to 1 by default. A Vision of 1 means you can see 6 Hexes around yourself, plus the one you are standing on.



When another player moves into an Adjacent Hex that you have Vision of, a map will be provided and the other Hero will wait for your next Action. You can see what Map Phase looks like in one of the posts. If your Resting is interrupted, so is your regeneration from that specific Rest.



Combat Phase



The spots characters stand on in combat are called Tiles. All Entities start Combat 2 Tiles Away from each other unless Overridden. Movements in Combat consume Actions not Stamina. For basic 1v1 Combat simply saying move closer or move back will do.

There is a also Combat Phase grid attached to one of the posts, for your convenience.



When 2 players meet, they can interact with each other how they please. They can ally, fight, or make deals and sign contracts which the Gods will enforce. A group channel will be made for their interaction. If you want to do something without your opponent knowing, for example, launch a sneak attack, you can do so by typing in your private channel.



In combat you take turns doing actions, the turn order depends on the encounter and the Initiative Roll. All actions are defined in the Informatorium.

Preparation allows you to skip your turn in order to do 2 non-ability Actions next Turn; Channel allows you to do 2 Ability Actions next Turn;

(E.g. If you have a tornado spell and a fire spell you can make a Flaming tornado by channeling for 1 turn and casting the 2 abilities in 1 Turn at the same Target) Combining Elemental Damage creates new Damage Types with stronger effects which can improve your odds.



In Combat, after the opponent made his call on what he does, (as long as you can see it) you can react with a Counter Action(E.g. Dodge), but you have to do it before the GM types out that result of that Action. All Entities have 1 Counter Action which refreshes at the start of their Turn. Dodging and rolling lower transforms the damage source into a critical Hit, if it was already a critical Hit it transforms it into a Vital Hit.



You can only flee from combat on your turn if you are 2 Tiles away from the closest hostile entity or if you are on the Outer Layer. It takes an action plus a dice roll and STAMINA to do so.



Level Up



When you level up you automatically gain 10 Max Health and 10 Max Resource. (Max Level 12)

You get 1 Stat Point: Used to increase Health/Resource by 10 or Defense/Dispersion by 1.

You Get 1 Attribute Point: Used to increase Strength/Dexterity/Power by 1.

You Get 1 Skill Point: Used to learn Skills. Check the Skill Tree in the PDF for more Details

You Get 1 Attunement Point: Used to invest in Resonance, Mastery or Legacy.

You Get 1 Ability Point: Used to Learn a new Ability or Upgrade a learnt ability.



Faith



Faith starts at 0. This stat can range from 3 to -3.

You can gain Faith at Shrines (by sacrificing Gold, Blood or items) or lose Faith through different interactions.

Positive Faith will automatically prevent death up to 50 Health lost, whilst having Negative Faith all your D20 Rolls will have a -1 Modifier for each Negative Faith. (For using Faith abilities check Informatorium on the link above)

Abilities

Ability Points can be used to Learn/Rank Up an Ability; When Learning an Ability roll a d3 to exclude one of your potential choices; In order to Learn a Tier II Ability you require a Tier I Ability; The same logic applies for Tier III Abilities; This does not apply for Ultimate Abilities; At level 6 and 12 you gain an Ultimate Ability Point which can only be used for Ultimate Abilities. For more information about Ability types research the Informatorium Tab and for the exact Abilities an Affinity has check the Abilities Tab.



Skills



There are 6 Skill Branches, 3 Basic(Utility/Combat/Survival) and 3 Advanced(Mastery/Knowledge/Leadership)

At Level 1 you start with 1 Skill Point in the middle at the 0 Mark.

Each Level up Grants a Skill Point which can be invested in skills. (Circles)

You may only invest in skills connected by a thin line.



The Keystones(Hexagons) can only be invested in once all

adjacent basic skills(Combat/Utility/Survival) connecting with thick lines are unlocked.

(E.g. for the Leadership Keystone Combat 8 and Utility 5 are required.

Their effects are Class dependent and they can be found in Excel under
Skills Tab)



Attunements



Attunement Points can be invested in Resonance, Mastery or Legacy; Attunements can not be higher than your Level.

We advise you to check the 3 corresponding channels in the excel for more details regarding each Attunement!



RESONANCE: Unleash Elemental Abilities for both offense and utility.

Resonance has a Maximum and Current Value; Resonance is directly linked to your Characters Wavelength(Which determines which abilities you can cast); Resonance is fully restored at the start of Day.

Resonance has a balanced scaling and revolves around efficiency. It is a solid choice through all stages of the game.

MASTERY: Progress in your chosen Mastery and unleash powerful abilities while dominating with strong passive bonuses.

Every Class has 2 Masteries they can choose out of; Once chosen you are locked into your choice and Mastery points will increase that specific one; Increasing Mastery will simply advance the Mastery Tree.

Mastery has power spikes every three levels; which means you might need to push through some underwhelming masteries until you reach the spikes.



\[Advanced]

LEGACY:  Tell the Planes your own story, change your Kin and evolve to new heights. Your birth given Race has not stopped you from pushing your limits.

Points invested in Legacy will advance the Legacy Tree; at level 4 you may choose to switch your Kin; At level 6 if you have not changed your kin you may choose a Path (E.g. Become a Vampire), otherwise you will be forced into one.

Legacy is late game oriented with very good scaling post level 6; It also offers 1 early game spike to allow survivability until the later stages.

IMPORTANT

It is the players' responsibility to do their turns in a timely fashion and notify the GMs with their availability or inability to do turns. Communicated delays will be excused, ghosting and disrespect of the GM's and other players' time will not.

It is also the players' responsibility to keep track of their own stat sheet. If a GM missed something they will not go back in the past, so pay attention and try to correct them if need be.

Any sort of harassment towards others and any sort of cheating (including private messages of campaign-specific information to other players) will result in removal from the campaign and ban from the server.
